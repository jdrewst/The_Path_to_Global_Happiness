# The Path to Global Happiness: Uncovering Insights Through SQL Analysis
By John Andrew Trogon

BACKGROUND

A country is more than just its land, borders, or territoriesâ€” it is a home for its people, a place where happiness and well-being matter. But, how can we consider that a country is filled with happiness? 

In recent years, a landmark survey assessed global happiness, ranking countries based on their happiness scores. This report includes key factors such as economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity, each contributing to the overall happiness score of one country. 

While this report provided the answer for my initial question, I still wanted to explore further this topic. Therefore, I analyzed the data from 2015 to 2017 to uncover some patterns in global happiness.

This analysis aims to answer the following questions:
  1. What commonalities exist among the top 10 happiest countries from 2015 to 2017?
  2. What is the average happiness score per region?
  3. Among the six factors, which one has the most significant impact on happiness?

Insight: With this graph, we can can already say that happiness is directly proportional to economic status. The economis of low-ranking regions such as Southeastern Asia, Southern Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa are evidently lagging behind compared to other regions.

Correlation of Each Factors and Happiness Score:

Insight: This graph justified my claim that economy significantly affects the happiness score of a country. 

CONCLUSION

Based on the analysis, the commonalities among happiest countries is their good economy. Therefore, we can conclude that a country can attain national happiness by prioritizing economic growth while strengthening the other key factors. Additionally, by taking a balanced approach, nations can create lasting prosperity and happiness for all citizens.
